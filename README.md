# MentionPack
Pack that helps you to manage local groups inside your chat and mention them

## Features
You can form groups out of users in your chat, for example you can form a `dota2` group.

To add users to group use command _mgadd_  
(Here for someUsername1... you should use telegram usernames like @theseems)  
``/mgadd dota2 <someUsername1> <someUsername2> ...``
  
Then when you want to play with them, simply write a message:  
`@dota2 let's go dota!`
  
Bot will mention all of them like that **using invisible mentions**:  
`ðŸ”” let's go dota!`

## Commands
```
/mgdel <mentionGroupName>
- Remove (while) mention group

/mgrem <mentionGroupName> <someUsername1> <someUsername2> ...
- Remove user(s) from mention group

/mgadd <someUsername1> <someUsername2> ...
- Add user(s) to mention group

/mggat <groupName> <text> (or you can type @<groupName> <text>)
